I wasn't going to push this but I figured since I'd done it, I might as well. I'm currently an instructor's associate at General Assembly and the class is starting their project for Unit 1. The project objective is to build out a game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. They have a choice between a few games and hangman is an option. I decided to work out the one of the project's MVPs to be prepared for any questions as they came so if you're reading this and the code along with it, that's what you're looking at and why there's not much to it. The main take away from the project in my opinion is for students to demonstrate and practice their understanding of vanilla Javascript/jQuery, DOM manipulation, handling events, conditionals, data types, CSS, and HTML. Thanks for taking a peek!
